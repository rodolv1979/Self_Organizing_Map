# Self_Organizing_Map


This is a scholastic implementation of an neural network model. The neural network is a self organizing map, pretty famous labeledas kohonen map. The map is supposed to recognize a simple input constitued by different colors, autorganizing its proper 
topological structure according to the input. 

As you can see from the video (see the file .ogv) this projects implements a simple GUI made with Qt++. Also the code about 
neural network modeling is supported by it++ libraries. Both are necessary when one wants to run this project.
